    It is great to hear from you.  The book is $29.95 plus $3.00 for
shipping and handling.
As far as his "forfeiting one month's pay", I wouldn't give it a lot of
thought.  After all, the men of the 5th were engaged in a war which
enveloped their home and family.  They not only had to be concerned about
themselves and staying alive, but their families being starved, sick, and
badly treated by not only the enemy but at times their own army.  Many of
them left to take care of their families and were AWOL for a short period of
time.  There are letters in the book which atest to this.  The men of the
north didn't have this problem since their homes weren't occupied by the
enemy.    During December, 1863, the men were in winter camp and very little
was happening.  There was no reason for him to leave since they weren't
traveling or engaged in fighting.  From this period until April, men many
were sent home to "guard their family property".   Also, please remember
that they wouldn't have just let him forfeit a month's pay if he had left
under fire or while on guard duty, etc.
    I suggest that you request his must roles and pension files from the
National Archives.  You must request that they supply the entire file and
not just the application forms.  There may be a letter or two that will
explain the specifics.  Many men applied for a pension and this type of
question arose.  When it did, they had to give a good explanation before
being considered fr a pension.
    I still hope you want the book.  I basically wrote it for descendants
such as yourself to understand what their ancestors and their families had
to endure.  If you do, sent the check to Bob Cannon, 10611 Kinross Ct.,
Louisville, KY 40243.  You may also want to look at the web site for the
book at http://home.earthlink.net/~fifthtenn/index.html  Let me know what
you think.
                                                        Best Regards,  Bob
