Bob:

This is great!  I will add the link to the Civil War Links and Resources pages today. I've already linked to the Monroe County site in several locations. The Quarterly site is rather extensive and getting more and more so every day.  I love it. If it wasn't for the fact that the January issue has already been put to bed I'd put something in it.  I surely want you to write something for the April issue if you will.

My address is 312 Proctor Drive, Columbia, MO  65202-1436.  Home: (573) 449-0932  Business: (573) 268-7209  FAX: (573) 449-6792.

Most of my ancestors are buried there in the St. Paul Lutheran Church Old Cemetery.  James Lee's father Jonathan and grandfather Daniel are buried there.  Daniel married Sarah Moser who was the daughter of Francis Moser the Revolutionary War patriot.  Daniel is listed on the roster of a unit that served in 1812.  So far we've been able to trace all Summit(t)s back to either Jacob or Franz Johann Sammet but we've been unable to connect them.

My wife Mary and I are planning a trip this spring to Chattanooga to do research.  I want pictures and I need to get a feel for the action that took place there more than just reading everything on the battle I can get my hands on can do.  Perhaps we can swing north through Louisville and meet.

Thanks for the offer concerning the non-published materials.  I'm looking for any references to James Lee that I can come up with.  James Lee was in H company so I'm interested in everything they did.  Family stories has it that James Lee was awarded some sort of commendation for valor at Lookout Mountain but I can find nothing about it. The story does say that he was stationed at a location where he was to stop fleeing Union troops so we've got some connection there.

I have a picture of James Lee Summitt taken sometime after the war.  I believe it is posted on the web in the April 1995 issue.  If not, I'll make sure that a copy gets posted here in the next couple of days.

It is so great to have found your site and get the opportunity to discuss this with you.  What do you do?  I've spent most of my life working in or teaching television news.  I've written about five books on Computers and currently I do contract programming while I work on a couple of other book ideas I've got.  In addition to the Family Quarterly that is <VBG>.  If you're interested there's more on the Summitt New Media site including some of my programs, both fiction and non-fiction writings, and book reviews.

Gotta run . . . Mary says we have to get the van re-licensed before the 31st.

later

    I would be honored to have you link to the web site and write in your
newsletter.  Just let me know.  Send me your address and I will put a book
in the mail now.  You can pay me whenever you want.
    My great-grandfather's family lived in Monroe Co.  His father was the
first county court clerk.  He lived on Union Fork Creek.  I had other
relatives in Philadelphia which is now Loudon Co.  Monroe was one of the few
counties which had more confederates than union supporters during the war.
I have spent a great deal of time there.  My g-grandfather's cemetery is
still on Rarity Bay the new golf community there.  Where do you live?  You
may want to link to Monroe Co. from your page if you haven't already.
    I'm glad to know your Louisville connection.  My wife and I both grew-up
in Knoxville but we have been here for 25 years.  Dannie taught at Waggener
High and my sons went to Manual and Male.  We live off Hurstbourne Lane a
couple of miles and would live to hear from you if you get to Louisville.
    The 5th barely missed Chickagmauga.  They had been stationed in Carthage
and marched to Chattangooga just  before the battle.  They were stationed at
the foot of Lookout Mtn.  and ordered to stop the retreating troops fleeing
the battle.   By the way, I have a great deal of detailed information not in
the book.  If you ever have any questions, I'm willing to look through
everything I have to get you an answer.  The 5th crossed Lookout Mtn. on the
way there.  In fact, the regimental commander, James T. Shelley, barely got
to his in-law's house on Lookout Mtn. as it was about to be looted.  He
stopped it at that time, but it was later burned to the ground.  It is
called the Cravens House and has been rebuilt.  Shelley was from Alabama and
married a member of the Cravens family when they lived in Roane Co.
Shelley's dad was a Col. in the Louisianna Tigers and his brothers were also
in the Confederate army.
    If you have any pictures or information on members of the 5th, please
send it to me.  I have had contact with many descendents since writing the
book and I'm keeping an archive.  By the way, the 5th is being re-enacted
now both in the U.S. and England.  One of the great accomplishments of the
book of which I'm proud.  Of the over 7,000 union regiments, not many still
have the flag flying!
